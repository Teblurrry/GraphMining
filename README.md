In social networks, understanding hidden or potential connections between users can enhance recommendations, community detection, and network growth.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for mining patterns from such data.
In this project:
- A real-world Facebook social network dataset will be used
- GAT, GCN, GraphSAGE, and Node2Vec are implemented
- Link prediction performance comparison
- Model insights showing via visualize predicted links
